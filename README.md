# CCEMSExt

Simple Firefox extension for CCEMS members that speeds up log in processes for commonly used web site applications. All this does is recognize the login pages and automatically fill in the company ID/agency name fields as appropriate.

## Usage
The `ccemsext.xpi` file is the signed extension file for use in Firefox. To install, download this file and save it somewhere you can find it. Open Firefox, type `about:addons` into the address bar and hit the enter/return key. Click the gear icon on the right, then click "Install Add-on From File..."
